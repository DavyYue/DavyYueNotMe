												<i>Preface: Hey guys! So I wrote this short essay as part of my Common App profile for college 
													applications, and I kinda fell in love with what I wrote. Also, I need some content to kick off
													this awesome blog. What better content than straight outta the archives? Hope you enjoy as well! </i>
													<br><br>
													As the stage lights fade and the velvet curtains rise, the magician strides from a side door
													to the center stage. Almost every audience member has impatiently waited weeks for this great
													theatrical performance advertised in bold, commanding words on eye-catching posters and across
													eager people’s lips. Tingling with anticipation from the crowd’s excitement, the air embraces the
													night’s series of thrilling festivities to come. <br><br>
													Before beginning the first spectacle, the magician strikes his hands together and
													summons a hushed silence. From his right pocket, he produces a sheet of printer paper, a
													mundane staple in every office workplace, and dances his fingers around its edges. After putting
													on a blindfold, the magician begins manipulating the paper, his hands diligently crafting every
													fold, calculating every crease, and measuring every surface. In the timespan of less than a
													minute, the magician conceives an origami swan that can swiftly flap its wings and seems as if it
													could soar into the skies at any moment. With the following spectacles that go on into the night,
													he makes each origami model more intricate than the previous, producing among which a fourlayered
													origami box variation of the Russian Matryoshka dolls, an icosahredron consisting of
													thirty sonobe units, a beautiful rose which almost blends in with its living counterpart, a delicate
													Chinese vase for presenting an exquisite bouquet, a braided Christmas wreath to celebrate the
													seasonal festivities, and a three-dimensional snowflake that dares to melt at any hint of heat,
													among others. <br><br>
													As the magician himself, I experienced each moment of that evening with excitement, my
													memories tending to exaggerate with each elated recall. Although occurring in the living room of
													my own home in front of family and friends, the performance nevertheless embedded itself as a
													treasured memory and bolstered my pursuit of learning more sophisticated origami models.
													Studying online origami tutorials and coincidentally meeting some generous strangers who
													instilled in me their personal origami wisdom, I have accumulated, since the age of ten, expertise
													in fifteen base folds that serve as generic origami-production blueprints and seven fold
													techniques for expanding upon said blueprints. Utilizing these fundamentals, I amassed
													knowledge of how to make a total of twenty-five models, more than half of which I can produce
													blindfolded. <br><br>
													Yearning to enlighten fellow students with first-hand experience of how origami
													heightens manual dexterity, improves eye-hand coordination, and enhances visualization of 3D
													objects in space, I founded the Origami Club during my sophomore year of high school. Within
													the club, I instruct one or two origami models at every meeting and strive to ensure that all
													members leave each meeting with full comprehension of how every fold or crease was made.
													Although I did inspire many members of my club to employ their origami craft in academic
													projects and for personal entertainment, the Origami Club made the deepest imprints on me, its
													founder; successive meetings patiently guided me to become a finer teacher, and preliminary
													advertising requirements coached me on the invaluable nature of humor. Noting that an effective
													member-recruiting advertisement demands a humorous saying to augment memorability, I
													devised an origami epigram that has proclaimed the Origami club’s presence whenever
													mentioned: “Do you even fold, bro?” Within weeks of its conception, other organizations, eager
													to join in the phrase’s successful dispersion throughout the student body, devised derivatives of
													the saying, such as “Do you even literature, bro?” In addition through the Origami club, I became
													an effective teacher through diligent lecture preparation that promotes “eureka!” moments in
													students; I was enlightened as to how repeated demonstrations encouraged untried approaches to
													an enigma. <br><br>
													With my talent of many origami models and subsequent invention of the Origami club,
													my origami skill has embedded itself deep within my identity. I would be more than happy to
													contribute my origami knowledge to your university through the creation of a club or other
													avenues if admitted.</p>
