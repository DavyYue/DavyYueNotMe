													So, Fortnite came out many fortnights ago, and I swear I’ve seen so many people doing the Floss, 
													Orange Justice, and Electro Shuffle at social parties as well as occasionally in the middle of 
													lecture after finding out they’ve aced a prior exam. To my own regret, I’ve also witnessed a lovely 
													elderly lady attempt the Floss only to look like she was a background dancer to an explicit rap music 
													video. Thank goodness I haven’t seen too many Fornite dances, or I’d have a few brain cells fewer today 
													to write this blog post. <br><br><br>

													Now let’s get on to the <i>real talk.</i>
													<br><br><br>

													The kind of dancing I’m writing about here is the formal type of dancing where a ballroom dance couple 
													drifts across the floor as both a raging stream and calming river in ebbs and flows, rises and falls. 
													My other favorite kind of dance secondary to ballroom is social partner dancing, such as east coast 
													swing in business casual attire. Tertiary would be classic party dancing as seen at Tailgates or BYX 
													parties. But, we’ll focus on the first two types.
													<br><br>

													In general, both ballroom and social partner dancing has provided me with a positive outlet for a weeks’ 
													worth of stressful exams and difficult homework, as well as a great means to build and fortify incredible 
													self-confidence. Regardless of the convoluted recursive-backtracking problem or a difficult technical-coding 
													interview session, all is well with social dancing at the week’s end. Self-confidence in social dancing 
													originates from not only realizing that “Wow, these beautiful people have a great time dancing with me,” 
													but also that “I look damn fine as a dancer and I love the feeling no matter who says otherwise.” 
													As a domino affect, my heightened self-confidence has propelled me to venture into unknown territory. 
													I serve as the youngest crew member on a board full of tech professionals with 30+ years experience for 
													a minority-led, nonprofit tech conference organization Music City Tech with annual event of over 700+ 
													attendees. In addition, I serve as a VandyHacks logistics organizer for an annual hackathon of 450+ students, 
													perform as a Cafe Con Leche bachata dancer for a 500+ audience, and others.
													<br><br>
													
													My college weeks are now spent yearning for the week’s end at a friday evening east-coast swing dancing social 
													at the Global Education Center or saturday night dance at the Nashville Ballroom Company. Throughout the week, 
													I drop by the Vandy Ballroom lessons and popular social partner dance venues close to the Vanderbilt University 
													Campus.  Since the summer after my sophomore year, I have now added a total of six dances to my repertoire: east 
													coast swing, salsa, bachata, rumba, waltz, foxtrot, and others to-be determined as I enroll in more lessons. Now 
													that I’m spending my weekends at social dances, I couldn’t be happier.
													<br><br>
													
													From my social and ballroom dancing, I’ve learned quite a few lessons as lead, two of which are of utmost importance. 
													A primary lesson would be to never give up, no matter how hard the dance move - unless the move is a dip, then you 
													better as damn well be freaking sure that you keep a perfect record of not dropping any of your lady dance partners. 
													After all, when the beat drops, your follow partner should absolutely not. A secondary lesson involves just having
													a damn plain old good time. 
													<br><br>
													
													To accommodate the approximate five hours of weekly commitment to practice and socials with dancing, I have adopted 
													a new studying dogma, which I call the “8-6 business hours.” This studying strategy requires me to attend classes, 
													hit the books, and cry over my assignments all within the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, and only within that strict time-frame 
													of operating hours. However, subscribing to this strict work-ethic requires waking up at the earth-shattering hours of 
													seven in the morning. Yet, a great benefit opens up my evening time of 6:01 pm to midnight - about six hours total - 
													to be more diligent in my extracurricular commitments, regular workout exercises, and, most importantly, dance 
													socials or practices.<br><br>
														
													I would recommend anyone, even you the occasional reader, to investigate any social or ballroom dancing opportunities 
													as soon as possible if not already; I would advocate starting with east coast swing, in which I myself started this 
													enjoyable adventure. After my sophomore year at the summer’s beginning, I saw myself on the dance floor as a 
													flopping-fiordland penguin, and, by the end of that summer, I had transformed into a graceful king-emperor with some 
													sweet moves to prove it. My metamorphosis happened through a friend’s initial invite to summer weekly Big Band Dances 
													at Centennial Park (Nashville, TN) and successive visits to Fred Astaire Dance Studio for a summer-ending week’s worth 
													of introductory classes. The rest, I can say rest assured, is now history and the present. I very much recommend both 
													of these esteemed events/venues for fine-tuning your body instrument to the sways of jazz for swing for the drum beats 
													of latin music for bachata.<br><br>
														
													However, I would inform the reader that Fortnite dance moves are banned from any of these premises and performing 
													such indecent acts will result in proper disciplinary action from an elderly Floss-ing lady with her forty pound handbag. 
													Let this be an exercise for the reader.<br><br><br>
														
													As usual, thank you so much for reading my story about how I both started and continue enjoying partner dancing. 
													Please stay tuned and hope to see you at my future blog posts. Have a great weekend.<br><br><br>

												<i>Preface: Hey guys! So I wrote this short essay as part of my Common App profile for college 
													applications, and I kinda fell in love with what I wrote. Also, I need some content to kick off
													this awesome blog. What better content than straight outta the archives? Hope you enjoy as well! 
													<br><br>
													P.S: That picture showcases my 36-piece origami dodecahedron that decorates my living room 
													entrance at home. Enjoy this writing piece! </i>
													<br><br><br>
													As the stage lights fade and the velvet curtains rise, the magician strides from a side door
													to the center stage. Almost every audience member has impatiently waited weeks for this great
													theatrical performance advertised in bold, commanding words on eye-catching posters and across
													eager people’s lips. Tingling with anticipation from the crowd’s excitement, the air embraces the
													night’s series of thrilling festivities to come. <br><br>
													Before beginning the first spectacle, the magician strikes his hands together and
													summons a hushed silence. From his right pocket, he produces a sheet of printer paper, a
													mundane staple in every office workplace, and dances his fingers around its edges. After putting
													on a blindfold, the magician begins manipulating the paper, his hands diligently crafting every
													fold, calculating every crease, and measuring every surface. In the timespan of less than a
													minute, the magician conceives an origami swan that can swiftly flap its wings and seems as if it
													could soar into the skies at any moment. With the following spectacles that go on into the night,
													he makes each origami model more intricate than the previous, producing among which a fourlayered
													origami box variation of the Russian Matryoshka dolls, an icosahredron consisting of
													thirty sonobe units, a beautiful rose which almost blends in with its living counterpart, a delicate
													Chinese vase for presenting an exquisite bouquet, a braided Christmas wreath to celebrate the
													seasonal festivities, and a three-dimensional snowflake that dares to melt at any hint of heat,
													among others. <br><br>
													As the magician himself, I experienced each moment of that evening with excitement, my
													memories tending to exaggerate with each elated recall. Although occurring in the living room of
													my own home in front of family and friends, the performance nevertheless embedded itself as a
													treasured memory and bolstered my pursuit of learning more sophisticated origami models.
													Studying online origami tutorials and coincidentally meeting some generous strangers who
													instilled in me their personal origami wisdom, I have accumulated, since the age of ten, expertise
													in fifteen base folds that serve as generic origami-production blueprints and seven fold
													techniques for expanding upon said blueprints. Utilizing these fundamentals, I amassed
													knowledge of how to make a total of twenty-five models, more than half of which I can produce
													blindfolded. <br><br>
													Yearning to enlighten fellow students with first-hand experience of how origami
													heightens manual dexterity, improves eye-hand coordination, and enhances visualization of 3D
													objects in space, I founded the Origami Club during my sophomore year of high school. Within
													the club, I instruct one or two origami models at every meeting and strive to ensure that all
													members leave each meeting with full comprehension of how every fold or crease was made.
													Although I did inspire many members of my club to employ their origami craft in academic
													projects and for personal entertainment, the Origami Club made the deepest imprints on me, its
													founder; successive meetings patiently guided me to become a finer teacher, and preliminary
													advertising requirements coached me on the invaluable nature of humor. Noting that an effective
													member-recruiting advertisement demands a humorous saying to augment memorability, I
													devised an origami epigram that has proclaimed the Origami club’s presence whenever
													mentioned: “Do you even fold, bro?” Within weeks of its conception, other organizations, eager
													to join in the phrase’s successful dispersion throughout the student body, devised derivatives of
													the saying, such as “Do you even literature, bro?” In addition through the Origami club, I became
													an effective teacher through diligent lecture preparation that promotes “eureka!” moments in
													students; I was enlightened as to how repeated demonstrations encouraged untried approaches to
													an enigma. <br><br>
													With my talent of many origami models and subsequent invention of the Origami club,
													my origami skill has embedded itself deep within my identity. I would be more than happy to
													contribute my origami knowledge to your university through the creation of a club or other
													avenues if admitted.<br><br><br>

													<i>Wow! Thanks for reading this far - as a bonus, here's another short essay I wrote for my 
														University of Florida college application, which got admitted but I declined to pursue 
														Computer Science and Engineering Management at Vanderbilt University. This piece is about
														a kid's perspective on social injustice.</i><br><br><br>

													<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01_justice.jpg" style="height:30%" alt="" /></a><br><br>

													When I was twelve years old and still newly accustomed to the rich, luxurious taste of
													Oreos dipped into milk, I strolled over to my comfy usual position on the soft, cushioned
													loveseat — a piece of furniture, I had deduced, suitably named for watching the lovable, comedic
													antics of oversized Saturday-cartoon-special characters. As I flipped through the television
													channels searching for my favorite Samurai Jack series, I pressed the Next button once too far
													and was transported from my realm of happiness filled with casual weekend cartoons to one of
													dismal reality rampant with terror and greed. <br><br>
													 As a CBS news reporter on an unknown channel relayed the shocking story of atrocities
													inflicted on an innocent man, I wrapped a cotton blanket around myself, trusting the fabric to
													shield me somehow from the horror. In Chicago in 1982, Alton Logan was convicted of killing a
													security guard at a McDonalds, and his alibi had been ignored by the jury, who found him guilty
													of first degree murder. In 2008, new evidence in an affidavit surfaced and proved Logan’s
													innocence, setting him free after twenty-six years behind bars. While the reporter divulged
													further details, my perfect vision of powerful superheroes ready to conquer evil whenever duty
													called was shattered, and I realized how great the chasm lies between the real and the ideal.
													<br><br>
													 Although I desperately wished to comfort the poor, innocent man with a delicious Oreo
													carefully dipped in milk, I could not soothe him. I felt the reality of his suffering, yet, I was
													powerless to do anything. I began to acknowledge the veracity of why renowned leaders such as
													Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela labored at such great lengths to
													restore the scales of justice to impartiality: someone had to perform the deed.<br><br>
													 Before my revelation, I had always thought the powerful characters portrayed in world
													history textbooks to be merely phrases, dates, and plot lines to be memorized and regurgitated
													whenever called upon during an examination. Like objects encased inside solid-glass display
													cases, never to be touched and only to be observed, the renowned figures who instigated great, 
													peaceful protests seemed so foreign to me — observable yet intangible. Until my enlightenment,
													they never resonated in me as influential leaders who turned the tide on international issues such
													as racial inequality, excess imperialism, and apartheid. <br><br>
													 Now, having rectified my beliefs, I admire the perseverance of Martin Luther King Jr. to
													fulfill his dream of racial equality filling the corners of every nation, despite having been thrown
													in jail innumerable times and labeled dozens of despicable names in response to his efforts. I
													applaud the determination of Gandhi to defy oppressive British tax on a daily commodity by
													extracting natural salt from the Arabian Sea Coast mud alongside thousands of other protesters,
													despite having been arrested and confined to compact, constrained quarters. I revere the fortitude
													of Mandela to negotiate the end of apartheid in a racially-divided South Africa, despite having
													been jailed for nearly three decades. <br><br>
													 Through these ordinary citizens who resolved to take action in the face of dubious odds,
													we are granted the freedoms that we exercise today. Through their efforts, we can stride down
													the paved road to victory, heads held high and arms unbound from the chains of injustice. <br><br><br>
